I mostly draw original characters, which all have their own lore and background — a lot of them are fandom characters with a wide array of alternate universe versions (because you can’t ever have enough.) I love to design outfits for my OCs and also dabble in some fanfiction and roleplay writing. Aside from that I craft a bit here and there, for either cosplay or LARP. I don’t nearly draw as much as I would like to, but it’s always the most fun to share my characters’ stories with other people!",
